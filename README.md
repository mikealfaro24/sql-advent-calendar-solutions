# SQL Advent Calendar 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the **Interview Master 24-Day SQL Advent Calendar Challenge (2025)**. The challenge followed a Christmas theme and included **24 SQL problems** released daily, with a mix of **easy, medium, and hard** difficulty levels.

I completed all 24 challenges and received a **Certificate of Completion** for successfully finishing the full series.

## About the Challenge

The SQL Advent Calendar is a festive coding challenge hosted by Interview Master that runs for 24 days in December. Each day features a new SQL problem inspired by real-world scenarios, gradually increasing in complexity and covering a wide range of SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions.

The goal of the challenge is to build consistency, problem-solving skills, and confidence in SQL through daily practice.
