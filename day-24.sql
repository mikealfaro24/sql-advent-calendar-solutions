-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

with cte_1 as (
 select 
  user_id,
  user_type,
  count(*) as comp_goals
from user_goals
where goal_status = 'Completed' 
group by user_id, user_type)
select 
  avg(comp_goals) as avg_goals
from cte_1
group by user_type
